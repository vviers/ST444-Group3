    "Our implementation of PSO relies on two fundamental abstractions (a _solver_ objet which manipulates a collection of _particles_) which are particularly suited to the Object-Oriented Programing (OOP) paradigm.\n",
    "\n",

    "## The `Particle` class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "We implement a Particle as having the following __attributes__:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a `position`: the current position of the particle. Initiated uniformly at random in the hypercube $[\\texttt{lower}, \\texttt{upper}]^{\\texttt{ndim}}$ where `lower`, `upper`, and `ndim` are provided by the user during class instantation. Implemented as a `numpy` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a `velocity`: the current velocity of the particle. Initiated as a random requence of -1s and 1s accross `ndim` dimensions. Implemented as a `numpy` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a `personal_best_position` and associated `personal_best_error` to keep track of a particle best known position and error (essentially the particle's memory). Initiated to the particle's original (random) position with an error of positive infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `c1`, `c2`, `w`: the cognitive, social, and inertia parameters. User-provided, with defaults 1, 2, and .5 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A Particle has the following __methods__:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `update_velocity(self, global_best)`: given the global best known position, update the particle's velocity according to the PSO rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `move(self)`: move the particle to a new position using the update rule $position_{t+1} = position_{t} + velocity_{t}$"

    "## The `PSO` class\n",

    "- `n_iter`: the number of iterations to run the PSO algorithm for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `parallel`: a `True/False` value indicating whether to run the PSO algorithm in Parallel. If `True`, a `pooler` attribute is also created which contains a `Pool` object from the `multiprocessing` module which pools together all your available CPUs at the exception of one."
