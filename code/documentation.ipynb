    "Our implementation of PSO relies on two fundamental abstractions (a _solver_ objet which manipulates a collection of _particles_) which are particularly suited to the Object-Oriented Programing (OOP) paradigm.\n",

    "### Attributes\n",
    "We implement a Particle as having the following __attributes__:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a `position`: the current position of the particle. Initiated uniformly at random in the hypercube $[\\texttt{lower}, \\texttt{upper}]^{\\texttt{ndim}}$ where `lower`, `upper`, and `ndim` are provided by the user during class instantation. Implemented as a `numpy` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a `velocity`: the current velocity of the particle. Initiated as a random requence of -1s and 1s accross `ndim` dimensions. Implemented as a `numpy` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a `personal_best_position` and associated `personal_best_fitness` to keep track of a particle best known position and fitness/error (essentially the particle's memory). Initiated to the particle's original (random) position with an error of positive infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `c1 = 1.49618`, `c2 = 1.49618`, `w = 0.7298`: the cognitive, social, and inertia parameters. User-provided, with defaults values picked following Van den Bergh and Engelbrecht (2006).\n",

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A Particle has the following __methods__:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `update_velocity(self, global_best)`: given the global best known position, update the particle's velocity according to the PSO rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `move(self)`: move the particle to a new position using the update rule $position_{t+1} = position_{t} + velocity_{t}$. By default, the particles are allowed to explore the search space beyond the initialisation boundaries. To avoid this behaviour, the user should adapt the target function by setting out-of-bound values to positive infinity (the induced discontinuity will not affect the algorithm's performance as it is derivative-free)"

    "\n",
    "- `global_best` and associated `global_best_fitness`: the global best known position along with the function value at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `function`: the function to be optimised. Of the form `f(Array:x) => Float:y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n_iter`: the number of iterations to run the PSO algorithm for. Since this number doesn't really make sense in the asynchronous case, we use a `n_func_eva` attribute instead which is computer as `num_particles * n_iter`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `__init__` and `__str__` to instatiate and print a PSO object.\n",

    "- `get_fitnesses(self)`: evaluate all particle's fitnesses. It is done differently depending on whether the algorithm runs in parallel or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `update_particles(self)`: updates each particle's best known position if it's current fitness is better than its previous best.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `update_best(self)`: get new best position and associated fitness, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `move_particles(self)`: run one iteration of the PSO algorithm. Update particles' velocities and makes them move.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `run(self, verbose=True)`: runs the algorithm for a prespecified number of steps, or until a convergence criterion is reached. Returns the algorithm's global best position. The `verbose` argument makes the output a little bit more informative."
