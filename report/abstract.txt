Our group project consists of an extensive description, discussion, and implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. After describing the simplest version of the algorithm -- including the theory behind its convergence and choice of hyperparameters -- and some of its applications, we turn to two parallel variants of PSO (synchronous and asynchronous). We implement all three versions of the PSO algorithm in python and test them on six classic optimization functions. While all of them perform very well on all functions, the parallel implementations typically take longer to run -- most likely due the relatively cheap cost of each PSO iteration and the overhead introduced by the parallelization of python processes.
